# SAS Protocol - Layer 3: C2PA Bridge (Rust)

## Overview
The **SAS Bridge** serves as the cryptographic injection layer. It is responsible for taking the **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** generated by the Midnight Network and embedding it into the file's metadata using the **C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity)** standard.

## Technical Architecture
* **Language:** Rust (Stable)
* **Core Dependency:** `c2pa-rs` (Adobe Content Credentials SDK)
* **Output Artifact:** `output_verified.jpg` (Cryptographically signed media)

## Implementation Status
This directory contains the scaffolding for the `ManifestBuilder` and `Signer` traits.

> **⚠️ INTEGRATION NOTICE:**
> The specific implementation of the `inject_zk_proof` function and the cryptographic binding of the Midnight Transaction ID to the C2PA Assertion Store are defined in **Section 4** of the **SAS Reference DApp Engineering Manual**.
>
> Licensed integrators should place the `main.rs` file provided in their onboarding package here to activate the injection logic.

## Build Command
